# LightningView
 A lightning-fast cross-platform image viewer written in Rust

This is a very slim image viewer that aims to replicate the most important functions found in commercial software like ACDSee.

Core Design goals:

* Lightweight
* Cross Platform
* Common image format support
* RAW file support for popular cameras (planned)
* Browsing through the current directory with arrow keys
* Pan/Zoom with the mouse
* Basic file operations such as deletion (planned)
* Quick way to start the default image editor (planned)
